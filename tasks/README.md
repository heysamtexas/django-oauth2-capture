# OAuth2 Capture Library - Task Management

This directory contains detailed task specifications for improving the oauth2_capture Django library. These tasks are designed to be executed by specialized subagents and provide comprehensive context for each area of improvement.

## Task Organization

### Priority Levels
- **High Priority**: Security fixes and basic testing infrastructure
- **Medium Priority**: Essential documentation
- **Low Priority**: Simple feature enhancements (avoid over-engineering)

### Task Categories

#### ðŸ”’ Security (`security/`) - HIGH PRIORITY
Essential security fixes for safe OAuth2 token handling:
- OAuth state verification (CSRF protection)
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Token refresh error handling 
=======
- Token refresh error handling
>>>>>>> faace65 (Add comprehensive OAuth security, testing, and coverage infrastructure)
- Token validation helpers
- Better error responses

#### ðŸ§ª Testing (`testing/`) - HIGH PRIORITY
Basic testing infrastructure for core functionality:
- Core OAuth flow tests
- Provider-specific test coverage
- Error scenario testing
- Token model testing

#### ðŸ“š Documentation (`documentation/`) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
Clear user and developer documentation:
- Re-authentication flow guidance
- Provider setup instructions
- Usage examples and best practices

#### âœ¨ Enhancements (`enhancements/`) - LOW PRIORITY
Simple feature additions (avoid over-engineering):
- New OAuth provider support (Google)
- Token encryption (using existing Django libraries)
- Basic admin interface improvements

## Task Document Structure

Each task document follows a consistent format:

```markdown
# Task Title

## Objective
Clear description of what needs to be accomplished and success criteria.

## Context
Background information about the current state and why this change is needed.

## Technical Details
Specific implementation guidance, architecture decisions, and code patterns.

## Testing Requirements
How to verify the solution works correctly.

## Dependencies
Other tasks or external requirements that must be completed first.

## Estimated Complexity
- Simple: 1-2 hours
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Medium: Half day to full day  
=======
- Medium: Half day to full day
>>>>>>> faace65 (Add comprehensive OAuth security, testing, and coverage infrastructure)
- Complex: Multiple days

## Files to Modify
Specific file paths and areas of the codebase that will be changed.

## Example Code
Concrete implementation examples where helpful.
```

## Execution Guidelines

1. **Start with High Priority Tasks**: Focus on security and testing first
2. **Maintain Django Simplicity**: Use standard Django patterns, don't over-abstract
3. **Avoid Over-Engineering**: If it feels complex, it probably is - simplify
4. **Test Essential Functionality**: Cover core OAuth flows, not edge cases
5. **Keep it Focused**: This package captures tokens, nothing more
6. **Use Existing Libraries**: Don't reinvent wheels (encryption, logging, etc.)

## Complexity Warning

This package should remain **simple and focused**. The core mission is:
```
User â†’ Authorize â†’ Store Token â†’ Refresh When Needed â†’ Use for API calls
```

Everything else is likely scope creep. When in doubt, **don't build it**.

## Current Library Context

- **Primary Use Case**: Capturing OAuth2 tokens for ongoing API access (not authentication)
- **Scale**: Low volume, typically single developers
- **Key Providers**: LinkedIn, X (Twitter), GitHub (Google planned)
- **Architecture**: Provider pattern with abstract base class for extensibility
- **Django Version**: 5.1+, Python 3.12+
